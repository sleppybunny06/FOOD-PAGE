    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine the seasonings and set aside.</li>
      <li>Melt the butter in a quart pot over medium heat. Add the diced onions and jalapeño pepper and cook for 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Add the flour and toss to coat. Cook for 2 minutes, until raw flour smell is gone.</li>
      <li>Add the chicken broth in small splashes, stirring continuously. Add the half - half in the same manner.</li>
      <li> Optional: Reserve 1 heaping cup of drained beans and combine it with ½ cup broth. Blend in a food processor, blender, or immersion blender. Add it to the soup along with the remaining whole beans. (This helps to thicken the broth.) Otherwise, all beans can be added whole.</li>
      <li>  Add the seasonings, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and green chilies. Bring to a boil. Let it boil gently for 15 minutes, uncovered, then reduce to a simmer.</li>
      <li>  Season each side of the chicken with salt/pepper. Add the chicken and the corn to the pot and let it simmer gently for 15-20 minutes, uncovered. (Cooking too rapidly will make the chicken tough.) Stir throughout cooking to lift any beans that may have settled to the bottom.</li>
      <li>  Remove the chicken and shred it once cooked through. Return it to the pot.</li>
      <li>  Reduce heat to low and stir in the softened cream cheese. Stir continuously until the cheese is fully melted into the chili.</li>
      <li>  Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Serve with cornbread!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, and hot sauce act as flavor enhancers and cant be tasted outright. I use Frank hot sauce for this recipe.
      Spice Lovers: If you like heat, I would use a little extra hot sauce and use a little more cayenne as well. Consider adding additional spice gradually and tasting until desired level is obtained.
      Make Ahead: This is a great recipe to make up to 2 days ahead of time and reheat on the stove top when ready to eat! </h2>
